            <b><p>IOT BASED CAMOUFLAGE ARMY ROBOT:<br></b></p>
                <p> DESCRIPTION: The idea of the Army Robot is based on the chameleon’s camouflage
                techniques. The aim of the project is to design, manufacture and operate via a Smart 
                phone, used as remote control device can reproduce the color accordingly with the ground 
                surface where it will be moving on, hence being camouflaged to the outside world. On the 
                other hand, we also created a system which can receive and decipher information received 
                from the Smart phone using IOT to further pilot motors which in turn drive the robot in any 
                required direction.
                The main motive behind Camouflage Robot is to reduce human losses in military 
                operations or terrorist attacks.</p>
